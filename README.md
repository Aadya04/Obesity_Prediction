Obesity and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are significant public health concerns, and early identification of at-risk individuals is key for effective prevention. This project aimed to build a multinomial regression model to classify individuals into different obesity risk categories based on demographic and health factors.

Model Development: Feature selection techniques, such as forward selection and backward elimination, were applied to identify the most influential predictors, ensuring both model efficiency and effectiveness.

Model Insights: The multinomial logistic regression model estimates the probability of an individual belonging to a specific obesity category, considering factors like age, weight, height (BMI), dietary habits, physical activity, and alcohol consumption.

Model Performance: The final model achieved an accuracy of 86%. Performance on both the training and test sets indicated good generalization, with no signs of overfitting.

Conclusion: The model is a solid fit, interpretable, and practical for public health applications, such as targeted interventions, resource allocation, and raising awareness for high-risk individuals. Regularization and feature selection were critical for improving model efficiency.
